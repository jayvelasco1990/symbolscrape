## What is vpfund?

vpfund is a self-hosted stock research tool built for value investors. It screens dividend-paying stocks across market cap tiers, calculates the **Graham Number** (intrinsic value), and surfaces **Debt/Revenue** and **Debt/EBITDA** ratios with color-coded risk levels — all scraped in real time from Finviz and Reuters.

No subscriptions. No API keys. No paywalls.

## Features

### Stock Screener
- Three market cap tiers — **Mega Cap** (>$200B), **Large Cap** ($10B–$200B), **Small Cap** ($300M–$2B)
- Pre-filtered for **dividend-paying** stocks with **low beta** and **RSI below 50** (oversold value candidates)
- Sortable columns via TanStack Table with **20-record pagination**
- URL-persisted tab and page state — hitting browser back restores exactly where you were
- Click any ticker to open its detail page — price passes through the URL for instant display

### Intrinsic Value (Graham Number)
- Calculates `√(22.5 × EPS × Book/sh)` for every stock using live Finviz data
- Shows **Stock Price**, **Graham Number**, and **Margin of Safety** side by side
- Color-coded card — green when undervalued, red when overvalued
- Progress bar showing where the current price sits relative to fair value

### Debt Metrics
- **Debt / Revenue** derived from `Debt/Eq × Book/sh × Shares Outstanding ÷ Sales`
- **Debt / EBITDA** derived from `Total Debt ÷ (Enterprise Value ÷ EV/EBITDA)`
- Four-tier risk badge per metric: `Conservative` · `Moderate` · `Elevated` · `High Leverage`
- Animated progress bars scaled to meaningful thresholds

### Stock Detail Page
- Price, company description (always sourced from Finviz for consistency)
- Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow from Finviz snapshot stats
- Supplementary financial tables from Reuters when available

### Symbol Lookup
- Search any ticker from the navbar — independent of the screener
- Navigates directly to the stock detail page with all metrics populated

## How Intrinsic Value is Calculated

The **Graham Number** is a formula by Benjamin Graham estimating the maximum fair price of a stock:

```
Graham Number = √(22.5 × EPS (ttm) × Book Value per Share)
```

**Margin of Safety** measures how far the current price is below that fair value:

```
Margin of Safety = (Graham Number − Price) / Graham Number × 100
```

A positive margin means the stock trades **below** intrinsic value — a classic value signal.

---

## How Debt Metrics are Calculated

All inputs come from the Finviz snapshot table:

```
Total Equity   = Book/sh × Shares Outstanding
Total Debt     = Debt/Eq × Total Equity

Debt / Revenue = Total Debt ÷ Sales
Debt / EBITDA  = Total Debt ÷ (Enterprise Value ÷ EV/EBITDA)
```
